# autoblogger-frontend
This project consists of a one-page autoblogger website. The purpose of this page is to generate, with AI, a full article text based on a title. So, the user inputs a text which serves as a title for their article, and the frontend sends that data to the backend, where it requests the chatGPT API to write an article based on that title, and then sends the information back.
The website also has an option to toggle the language from english to spanish. And soon, users will be able to create an account on the site, so they can store their AI-generated articles.
